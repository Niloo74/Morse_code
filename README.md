/**
 * 
 * This program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for translating between English and Morse code.
 * It uses a binary tree structure to store and retrieve Morse code mappings for characters.
 * 
 * The application allows users to:
 * - Translate an input English text into Morse code.
 * - Translate an input Morse code into English text.
 * 
 * Design:
 * - The Morse code is stored in a binary tree where '.' moves to the left node, and '-' moves to the right node.
 * - Each node in the tree corresponds to a character or symbol in English.
 * - For reverse translation, the tree is traversed by following the Morse code symbols.
